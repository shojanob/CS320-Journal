To ensure my code, program, or software is functional and secure, I write and run thorough tests, including unit, integration, and smoke tests. I regularly review my code and follow best practices like input validation, encryption, and secure authentication. Keeping dependencies updated and following secure coding guidelines also help me prevent vulnerabilities.

When interpreting user needs, I gather requirements through direct communication, research or feedback. I implement these needs into technical specifications while considering usability, accessibility, and performance. By emphasizing on development and incorporating user testing, I ensure the program meets expectations.

When designing software, I start by defining clear requirements, choosing the right structure, and planning data flow and interactions. I use design patterns, module code, and scalability considerations to create maintainable software.
